### In this course, we provided examples explaining the following concepts:
- How is test data file structured
- The setup and teardown structure
- How to use tags
- The 3 different styles of writing test cases, namely:
    - Keyword-driven
    - Behaviour-driven

Please run thru the examples in your spare time, to make sure you understand how the concepts work.
